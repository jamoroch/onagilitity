Agility is freedom and a challenge  in developing and delivering solutions to our customers. It is an opportunity for employees for the trust and freedom management (or Enablement like we call it in lexoffice) bestows upon us to do the right thing  by letting the people on the field make the decision that impact the customer the most. But agility is also a challenge not only because of the accountability that the given trust and freedom bring along themselves, but also because Agility is to some degree counterintuitive to what the human brain wants. This is, partly, what makes agile work so difficult. Agile calls for disbelief in status and certainty. Moreover, continuous inspection and adaption requires a great amount of creative discipline and disciplined action from Enablement and the people on the field.
